Smart contract that allows to create completely decentralized trading pairs.
It is like Ethereum's Uniswap but with some nice extra features:

(...explanation of connectors and pair-token...)

1- It can host arbitrary pairs in only one contract.

2- Initial fee and fee governance. An initial fee is set at initialization of each pair-token. In addition and optionally, a name of a smart contract is chosen. The fee might be controlled in the future by that smart contract. One good choice for the fee governance is through voting of the pair-token holders.
